About me:
I'm a 22 Y/O ex-web dev looking to get back into the realm of coding. With prior experience in python, I feel most comfortable starting my journey with it and I can't wait to share my newfound experiences and projects with everyone!

Goals for this course:
1. Relearn problem solving with python.
2. Become comfortable with the language and be able to use it in unison with other languages to build full-stack applications
3. Be able to help teammates and collaborators solve problems and share knowledge with them

My first Python Program:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
