### Week 1 reflection Journal

##### Use of AI
With the dawn of AI, many developers feel conflicted about the ethics of utilizing AI to boost their productivity. As I have always believed, AI should be embraced by the community. 
However, developers ultimately have the final say regarding their programs.
As the professor explained, AI will be a significant aid, but it is the developer who decides, "What more can we do to enhance the application?"

##### Drawing the line:
That being said, I also believe there should be boundaries when it comes to AI. AI should remain a mere tool in the developer's arsenal, a "helping hand," if you will. 

On one hand, a developer who uses AI effectively could potentially do the work of multiple developers, leading companies to reduce their workforce (similar to recent mass layoffs). 
I know from firsthand experience how much this has affected the morale of emerging developers, discouraging many from continuing or even starting in the first place.

On the other hand, AI shouldn't be something that a developer becomes completely reliant on, as this would represent a "destructive" approach to coding. 
During my experience working with groups, I observed a significant knowledge and problem-solving gap between developers who relied heavily on AI and those who did not. 
During the development phase of each application, the developer goes through many hours of problem-solving. 
If they do not embrace the challenges that come with the job, they will lack in critical thinking, problem-solving, and even coding knowledge. Therefore, overreliance on AI during coding can have lasting effects that might be application-breaking or even career-ending.

##### Quick Tip:
I have always been taught to approach a project with a clear plan. In my experience, developers with a good plan can navigate challenges with relative ease. Often, this also helps in learning new coding techniques and strategies.

I'm really excited to be using python again!
